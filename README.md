# BMI Calculator Android app | Kotlin
This is my first Android app as an assignment for the course "Mobile Programming with Native Technologies" at OAMK.
## Description:
This BMI Calculator Android app is a simple tool designed to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input of height and weight. 
It provides an easy-to-use interface for users to input their height in meters and weight in kilograms, and instantly receive their 
BMI result along with a corresponding message indicating their BMI category.
##### This is how the app looks like:
